This file is a placeholder.  It isn't included in the public API documentation.

If there are multiple public capture external event APIs, modify the index.html.md file to include this file right after where 
the _capture_external_event_api.md file is included and move the contents of the chat API here.  After moving the contents of
_capture_external_event_api.md to this file, the only thing left in _capture_external_event_api.md will be some header text.
