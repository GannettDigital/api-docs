## Contacts/Lead APIs

### **Contacts**
<a name="contacts"></a>

**Summary:** This HIPAA Compliant endpoint supports integration with CRM products. It returns all contacts (first name, last name, email and/or phone number) generated by a campaign for an advertiser. The response is organized by campaigns with the contacts nested within. Please note that the response also includes the associated contact and its meta data.

**Parameters:** It requires the following parameters for a successful response: GMAID (advertiser ID), created_before date and created_after_date.

**Recommended usage pattern:** A one-time call to the API to fetch all past interactions recorded by the LOCALiQ platform, followed by daily recurrent calls for a 2 -3-day period to fetch new interactions. The results are paginated. If there is no data for a particular attribute, it will not be present in the results.

Please note that the contact information in this endpoint is for linking the interactions/leads with the contact. Importing them as contacts into your CRM from this endpoint will cause duplicates.
