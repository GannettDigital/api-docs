# LOCALiQ App on Zapier®

**Summary:** Zapier® is a tool that allows two systems to exchange data without any coding. LOCALiQ makes available a lead app on the Zapier® platform for CRM integration.

- The LOCALiQ app on Zapier® is available at no additional cost. Please see note below.
- Advertiser IDs (GMAIDs) are maintained through Campaign Central/Corp and can be found in the general settings of your account settings.

**Note:** There is an additional monthly subscription cost through Zapier®. The cost depends on the number of leads sent per month and the number of leads transmitted between the systems (which Zapier® refers to as "Tasks"). Pricing information for Zapier® can be found [here](https://zapier.com/pricing).

**LOCALiQ App Options:**

There are two options under the LOCALiQ App on Zapier®.

 - **Contacts:** This trigger supports integration with CRM products. It delivers contact data (first name, last name, email, phone number, etc.) generated for an advertiser in near real-time.
 - **Contact Interactions:** This trigger supports integration with CRM products. It delivers all interactions (or leads) generated for an advertiser in near real-time. [View Data Details](#zapier_contact_interactions).

**Recommended Usage Pattern:**

This is a self-service solution and it is recommended for the client to use their Zapier® account and to create a Zap between our LOCALiQ leads app and their CRM app. Leads from all their campaigns will flow real time from our platform to their CRM.

As an alternative, if you would like LOCALiQ to create the Zap, maintain, and manage it using our Zapier® account, please reach your account team and request Offer 2095. This service is available at an additional fee.

## How Do I Connect to My LOCALiQ Account on Zapier?

1) Log in to your [Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) or create a new account.

2) Navigate to "My Apps" from the top menu bar.

3) Now click on "Connect a new account..." and search for "LOCALiQ"

4) Use your LOCALiQ business user credentials to connect your LOCALiQ account to Zapier.

  - Business User credentials are provided to you by your account team during account creation. These credentials allow you to access the account data through the APIs as well as the Client Center. If you need to check if you have a Business User created or need to reset your password, you can navigate to ReachSecurePay (https://reachsecurepay.com/client/index.php) and enter your email address. If you encounter the error message “Email Address is invalid” or “Email Address not found”, please contact your account management team. If you progress to the login screen, you can select “Create a new password” which will either send you a password reset email or allow you to set your password manually (this will only occur if your password has never been set).

  - The business user must be set up to allow access to HIPAA information to access HIPAA data through the API. You can reach your account team to check and/or edit privileges on your business user. Please follow the needed due diligence when adding HIPAA privileges to your business user account since the implications of it are far beyond API access to data. This control applies to APIs that provide data that are classified as HIPAA and protected by law.

5) Once that's done you can start creating an automation! Use a pre-made Zap or create your own with the Zap Editor. Creating a Zap requires no coding knowledge and you'll be walked step-by-step through the setup.
